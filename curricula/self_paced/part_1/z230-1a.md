Python 0-30 for Scientists
==========================

Welcome to the Python 0 to 30 for Scientists tutorial. In 
this self-paced course you will learn how to write Python 
code using Python best practices. 

Part 1 is designed to take one work day, but you may move 
through the content much slower or more quickly. 

Through these instructions you will develop scripts and use 
git and GitHub to save and organize your work. 

At the end of this tutorial you will have a grasp of how to 
begin building your own library of Python tools for your 
scientific analysis workflows.


Why Python?
-----------
You're already here because you want to learn to use Python 
for your data analysis and visualizations. Python can be 
compared to other high-level, interpreted, object-oriented 
languages, but is especially great because it is free and 
open source! 

### High level languages
   Other high level languages include MatLab, IDL, and NCL. 
   The advantage of high level languages is that they provide 
   functions, data structures, and other utilities that are 
   commonly used, which means it takes less code to get real 
   work done. The disadvantage of high level languages is 
   that they tend to obscure the low level aspects of the 
   machine such as: memory use, how many floating point 
   operations are happening, and other information related 
   to performance. C and C++ are all examples of lower level 
   languages. The "higher" the level of language, the more 
   computing fundamentals are abstracted.

Interpreted languages -
   Most of your work is probably already in interpreted 
   languages if you've ever used IDL, NCL, or MatLab 
   (interpreted languages are typically also high level). 
   So you are already familiar with the advantages of this: 
   you don't have to worry about compiling or machine 
   compatability (it is portable). And you are probably 
   familiar with their deficiencies: sometimes they can be 
   slower than compiled languages and potentially more memory 
   intensive than. 

### Objected Oriented languages
   Objects are custom datatypes. For every custom datatypes, 
   you usually have a set of operations you might want to 
   conduct. For example, if you have an object that is a list 
   of numbers you might want to apply a mathematical operation, 
   such as sum, onto this list object in bulk. Not every 
   function can be applied to every datatype; it wouldn't 
   make sense to apply a logarithm to a string of letters or 
   to capitalize a list of numbers. Data and the operations 
   applied to them are grouped together into one object. 

Open source - 
   Python as a language is open source which means that there 
   is a community of developers behind its codebase. Anyone 
   can join the developer community and contribute to deciding 
   the future of the language. When someone identifies gaps to 
   Python's abilities, they can write up the code to fill 
   these gaps. The open source nature of Python means that 
   Python as a language is very adaptable to shifting needs 
   of the user community.

Python is a language designed for rapid prototyping and 
efficient programming. It is easy to write new code quickly 
with less typing.

Part 1 - First Python Script
----------------------------

This section of the Zero to Thirty tutorial will focus on 
teaching you Python through the creation of your first script. 

You will learn about syntax and the reasoning behind why 
things are done the way they done along the way. 

We will also incorporate lessons on the use of git because 
we highly you recommend version controling your work.

We are assuming you are familiar with bash and terminal 
commands. If not here is a cheat sheet:

Part 1a - Reading a .txt File
--------------------------------------
In building your first Python script we will set up our 
workspace, read a .txt file, and learn git fundamentals.

Open a terminal to begin.

1. [bash] Create a directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir ncar_python_tutorial
   ```

   The first thing we have to do is create a directory to 
   store our work. Let's call it "ncar_python_tutorial".
   
2. [bash] Go into the directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd ncar_python_tutorial
   ```

3. [conda] Create a virtual environment for this project:

   ```bash
   $ conda create --name ncar_python_tutorial python
   ```

   A conda environment is a directory that contains a 
   collection of packages or libraries that you would like 
   installed and accessible for this workflow. Type 
   `conda create --name` , the name of your project, here 
   that is "ncar_python_tutorial," and then specify 
   that you are using python to create a virtual environment 
   for this project.

   It is a good idea to create new environments for different 
   projects because since Python is open source, new versions 
   of the tools you use  may become available. This is a way 
   of guaranteeing that your script will use the same versions 
   of packages and libraries and should run the same as you 
   expect it to.

4. [git] Make the directory a git repository:

   ```bash
   $ git init .
   ```
   
   This command adds version control to this new 
   ncar_python_tutorial directory and all of its contents.

5. [bash] Create a data directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir data
   ```

   And we'll make a directory for our data.

6. [bash] Go into the data directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd data
   ```
   Let's "cd" into the data directory. 

7. [bash] Download sample data:

   ```bash
   $ curl -O https://sundowner.colorado.edu/weather/atoc8/wxobs20170821.txt
   ```

   And download data from the CU Boulder weather station.

   This weather station is a Davis Instruments wireless 
   Vantage Pro2 located on the CU-Boulder east campus at the 
   SEEC building (40.01 N, 05.24 W, 5250 ft elevation). The 
   station is monitored by the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences 
   (ATOC) department and is part of the larger University of 
   Colorado ATOC Weather Network.
   
8. [git] Check the status of your repository

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

   You will see the newly downloaded file listed as an 
   "untracked file." Git status will tell you what to do to 
   untracked files. Those instructions mirror the next 2 steps:

9. [git] Add the file to the *git staging area*:

   ```bash
   $ git add wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
   By adding this datafile to your directory, you have made a 
   change that is not yet reflected in our git repository. 
   Type "git add" and then the name of the altered file to 
   stage your change.

10. [git] Check your git status once again

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

   Now this file is listed as a "change to be commited," i.e. staged.
   Staged changes can now be *commited* to your repository history.

11. [git] Commit the file to the *git repository*:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding sample data file"
   ```
   
   And then with "git commit", update your repository with all 
   the changes you staged, in this case just one file. 

12. [git] Look at the git logs:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   
   If you type "git log" you will show a log of all the 
   commits, or changes made to your repository.

13. [bash] Go back to the top-level directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd ..
   ```

14. [bash] Create a blank Python script:

   ```bash
   $ touch mysci.py
   ```

   And now that you've set up our workspace, create a blank 
   Python script, called "mysci.py"

15. [python] Edit the `mysci.py` file using nano, vim, or your 
   favorite text editor:

   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```

   Your classic first command will be to print "Hello World".

16. [python] Try testing the script:

   ```bash
   $ python mysci.py
   ```
   
   And test that the script works by typing "python" and then 
   the name of your script. 
   Yay! You've just created your first Python script. 
   
17. [python] You probably won't need to run your Hello World 
   script again, so delete the `print("Hello, world!")` line 
   and start over with something more useful - we'll read the 
   first 4 lines from our datafile.

   Change the `mysci.py` script to read:
   
   ```python
   # Read the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   datafile = open(filename, 'r')

   print(datafile.readline())
   print(datafile.readline())
   print(datafile.readline())
   print(datafile.readline())

   datafile.close()
   ```

   And test your script again by typing:

   ```bash
   $ python mysci.py
   ```
 
   First create a variable for your datafile name, which is 
   a string - this can be in single or double quotes.

   Then create a variable associated with the opened file, 
   here it is called `datafile`. 
   
   The `'r'` argument in the `open` command indicates that 
   we are opening the file for reading capabilities. Other 
   input arguments for "open" include `'w'`, for example, 
   if you wanted to write to the file.

   The `readline` command moves through the open file, always 
   reading the next line.

   And remember to `close` your datafile.

   Comments in Python are indicated with a hash, as you can 
   see in the first line `# Read the data file`. 
   Comments are ignored by the interpreter.

   Testing of your script with `python mysci.py` should be 
   done every time you wish to execute the script. This will 
   no longer be specified as a unique step in between every 
   change to our script.

18. [python] Change the `mysci.py` script to read your whole 
   data file:

   ```python
   # Read the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   datafile = open(filename, 'r')
   data = datafile.read()
   datafile.close()

   # DEBUG
   print(data)
   print('data')
   ```

   Our code is similar to the before, but now we've read the 
   entire file. To test that this worked. We'll `print(data)`. 
   Print statements in python require parenthesis around the 
   object you wish to print, here it is data. 
   
   Try `print('data')` as well, now Python will print the 
   string `'data'`, as it did for the hello world function, 
   instead of the information stored in the variable `data`.

   Don't forget to execute with `python mysci.py`

19. [python] Change the `mysci.py` script to read your whole 
   data file using a context 
   manager `with`:

   ```python
   # Read the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
      data = datafile.read()
   
   # DEBUG
   print(data)
   ```
   Again this is a similar method of opening the datafile, 
   but we now use `with open`. The `with` statement is a 
   context manager that provides clean-up and assures that 
   the file is automatically closed after you've read it. 
   
   The indendation of the line `data = datafile.read()` 
   is very important. Python is sensitive to white space and 
   will not work if you mix spaces and tabs (Python does not 
   know your tab width). It is best practice to use spaces as 
   opposed to tabs (tab width is not consistent between 
   editors).
   
   Combined 
   these two lines mean: with the datafile opened, 
   I'd like to read it.

   And execute with `python mysci.py`.

20. [python] What did we just see?  What is the `data` 
   object?  What type is `data`?  How do we find out?  
   Add the following to the
   `DEBUG` section of our script:
   
   ```python
   print(type(data))
   ```
   And execute with `python mysci.py`

   What did we just see?  What is the `data` object?  In the 
   'DEBUG' section of our script let's find out the type of 
   our data object. Object types refer to 'float' 'integer' 
   'string' or other types that you can create. 

   Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you 
   don't have to explicitly specify the datatype when you 
   name a variable, Python will automatically figure 
   it out by the nature of the data.

21. [git] Now, clean up the script by removing the `DEBUG`
   section, before we commit this to git.

22. [git] Let's check the status of our git repository

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```
   
   Note what files have been changed in the repository.

23. [git] Stage these changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add mysci.py
   ```

24. [git] Let's check the status of our git repository,
   again.  What's different from the last time we 
   checked the status?

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

25. [git] Commit these changes:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding script file"
   ```
   Here a good commit message `-m` for our changes would be 
   "Adding script file"

26. [git] Let's check the status of our git repository,
   now.  It should tell you that there are no changes
   made to your repository (i.e., your repository is
   up-to-date with the state of the code in your
   directory).'

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

27. [git] Look at the git logs, again:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   You can also print simplified logs with the `--oneline` option.

==========================

That concludes the first lesson of this virtual tutorial. 

In this section you set up a workspace by creating your 
directory, conda environment, and git repository. You 
downloaded a .txt file and read it using the Python commands 
of `open()`, `readline()`, `read()`, `close()`, and `print()`, 
as well as the context manager `with`. You should be familiar 
with the `str` datatype. You also used fundamental git 
commands such as `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, 
`git commit`, and `git logs`.

Please continue to part 1b.
