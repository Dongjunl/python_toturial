===========

Outline - Part 2 - First Python Package
---------------------------------------

12. [python] We now have 2 different modules related to the same project.  We could
   have put all of these new functions into the same module, but it is best practice
   to separate different functions into different modules depending upon the kind of
   functionality they represent.  In this case, we've separated out the concepts of
   "data input" and "printing output" into different modules.
   
   We could also do the same thing with the computation functions that we've already
   created, `compute_windchill` and `compute_heatindex`.
   
   Exercise: Let's move these functions into a new module called `computation.py`, 
   and modify the scripts to use this new module.  Remember to add docstrings!
   
   Solution: I did the following:
   
   ```python
   def compute_windchill(temp, windspeed):
       """
       Compute the wind chill factor given the temperature and wind speed

       NOTE: This computation is valid only for temperatures between
       -45F and +45F and for wind speeds between 3 mph and 60 mph.

       Parameters:
           temp: The temperature in units of F
           windspeed: The wind speed in units of mph
       """

       v16 = windspeed ** 0.16
       return 35.74 + 0.6215*temp - 35.75*v16 + 0.4275*temp*v16


   def compute_heatindex(temp, hum):
       """
       Compute the heat index given the temperature and the humidity

       Parameters:
           temp: The temperature in units of F
           hum: The relative humitidy in units of %
       """

       T = temp
       H = hum / 100
       HI = (-42.379 + 2.04901523*T + 10.14333127*H -
             0.22475541*T*H - 6.83783e-3*T**2 - 5.481717e-2*H**2 +
             1.22874e-3*T**2*H + 8.5282e-4*T*H**2 -
             1.99e-6*T**2*H**2)
       return HI
   ```
   
   And then modified the scripts accordingly.

13. [git] Stage and commit everything (`git commit -m "Creating computation module"`)

14. [python] Now, we've got quite a few Python files in our main directory.
   Which ones are scripts?  Which ones are modules meant to be imported?
   
   Typically, we group all of the modules meant for import only into another
   directory called a *package*.  A *package* is a directory with a `__init__.py`
   file inside it.
   
   So, let's create a new directory called `mysci` and create an empty file in it
   called `__init__.py`:
   
   ```bash
   $ mkdir mysci
   $ cd mysci
   $ touch __init__.py
   $ cd ..
   ```
   
   Then, let's move our 3 modules into this package:
   
   ```bash
   $ git mv readdata.py mysci/
   $ git mv printing.py mysci/
   $ git mv computation.py mysci/
   ```
   
   Then, let's modify the import statements at the top of our two scripts so
   that the modules are automatically imported from the new package:
   
   ```python
   from mysci.readdata import read_data
   from mysci.printing import print_comparison
   from mysci.computation import compute_heatindex
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Obviously introduces packages.  Should also talk about the
   fact that the `__init__.py` file is run when the package is imported.

15. [git] Stage everything (don't forget the `__init__.py` file!) and
   commit (`git commit -m "Creating mysci package"`)
   
   **NOTE:** Our commits are getting bigger, but that's okay.  Each commit
   corresponds to a *single* (conceptually) change to the codebase.
   
   With this last change, our project should look like this (ignoring the
   `__pycache__` directories:
   
   ```text
   mysci/
   
       data/
           wxobs20170821.txt
           
       mysci/
           __init__.py
           readdata.py
           printing.py
           computation.py
           
       heatindexcomp.py
       windchillcomp.py
   ```

16. [python] Let's take a brief aside and look at the use of the computation
   functions in our scripts.  In the case of the wind chill factor computation,
   it looks like this:
   
   ```python
   windchill = []
   for temp, windspeed in zip(data['tempout'], data['windspeed']):
       windchill.append(compute_windchill(temp, windspeed))
   ```
   
   This divides the initialization of the `windchill` variable as an empty `list`
   from the "filling" of that `list` with computed values.
   
   Python gives you some shortcuts to doing this via a concept called 
   "comprehensions", which are ways of initializing containers (`list`s,
   `dict`s, etc.) with an *internal loop*.  For example, we could have
   written the previous 3 lines in the form of a "one-liner" like so:
   
   ```python
   windchill = [compute_windchill(t, w) for t, w in zip(data['tempout'], data['windspeed'])]
   ```
   
   This is a *list comprehension*, and it initializes the entire list with the
   computed contents, rather than initializing an empy list and appending values
   to it after the fact.  Computationally, this is actually *more efficient*.
   
   Exercise: Use list comprehensions to make the computation steps in both of
   our scripts one-liners.
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces list comprehensions.  Should also mention dict comprehensions.
   Should also mention *conditional* comprehensions (i.e., `for ... in ... if` statements)

17. [git] Stage and commit changes (`git commit -m "Using list comprehensions"`)

18. [bash] [bash] Let's make a copy of our first script.
   
   ```bash
   $ cp windchillcomp.py dewpointtempcomp.py
   ```

19. [git] And add and commit this new file.
   (`git commit -m "Copying first script to start a third"`)

20. Write function for computing dew point and change columns and types dictionaries 
    ```python
    import math
    
    #columns names and column indices to read
    columns = {'date':0 , 'time':1, 'tempout':2, 'humout':5, 'dewpt':6}

    #data types for each column (only if non-string)
    types = {'tempout':float, 'humout':float, 'dewpt':float}

    def compute_dewpoint(temp, rel_humidity):
        T = (temp - 32) * 5 / 9 #F to C   #have a function for this
        H = rel_humidity / 100
        a = 6.112 #mbar
        b = 18.678
        c = 257.14 #degC
        gamma = math.log(H) + (b * T) / (c + T)
        tdp = c * gamma / (b - gamma)
        tdp_F = 9 / 5 * tdp + 32
        return tdp_F
        ```

21. add and commit
    git commit -m "  Computed dew point temperature"

22. refactor to mysci.compute and add docstring
def compute_dewpoint(temp, hum):
        """
        Compute the dew point temperature given the temperature and humidity

        Parameters:
                temp: The temperature in units of F
                humL: The relative humidity in units of %
        """

        T = (temp - 32) * 5 / 9 #F to C
        H = rel_humidity / 100
        a = 6.112 #mbar
        b = 18.678
        c = 257.14 #degC

        gamma = numpy.log(H) + (b * T) / (c + T)
        tdp = c * gamma / (b - gamma)
        tdp_F = 9 / 5 * tdp + 32
        return tdp_F

#calculate windchill
dewpointtemp = [compute_dewpoint(t, h) for t, h in zip(data['tempout'], data['humout'])]

23. add and commit
    commit -m "Moved dew point fx to computation.py"


#-------------------------------------------------

24. move to numpy
    
    Conda install numpy
    And use numpy so you can pass in a list without having to do for loops and zip
    convert all 3 scripts to work well with numpy

25. plot time vs dpt, time vs humidity, etc in matplotlib
    conda install matplotlib    
    
26.     contours of dewpoint, axis of temperature and humidity.
    but they'd need mapping of dewpoint to 2d (or use numpy to generate a new table of temp and humiity that we compute on)

27. get a different data set - satellite data LENS data
        take something from the geocat examples (great way to show gallery to recovering NCL users)
