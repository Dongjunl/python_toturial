Requirements & Installation
--------------------------

First, check that you have conda or miniconda installed 
on your OS. 

1. [bash] Check your conda version:

   ```bash
   $ conda --version
   ```
   At the time of writing this, the latest version of conda is 
   4.6. If you have an old version of conda installed, update 
   it.

2. [bash] If necessary, update:

   ```bash
   $ conda update
   ```

   If you don't have conda installed at all, please install it. 

   Use the instructions at 
   https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html 

   ***NOTE** If you have a REALLY old version of conda it might 
   be easier to delete it and then reinstall it. But before 
   doing this you have to check your env-list to see if there 
   are any environments you created and want to save.

3. Check your conda version again.

4. Install git

   Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. This 
   makes it easy to maintain access to multiple versions of 
   your code as you improve it, and revert your code back to 
   a previous version if you've made any mistakes.
