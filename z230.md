Python 0-30 for Scientists
==========================

This is an outline of the steps needed to teach Python 0-30.  The plan is to teach
Python in an example-based way demonstrating:

1. How to write Python code
1. Python best-practices
1. Coding with git & GitHub
1. Package management with Conda

with each being of equal importance.  This means that we intend to:

1. Use "the right" data structures for the intended task, without needed to depend upon external 3rd-party packages.
1. Commit early and commit often, so that each "lesson" is represented by a single git commit.
1. End the instruction with an installable package and demonstrate the usefulness of such packages.

Requirements & Assumptions
--------------------------

- Assumes a linux/mac OS (What about Windows?)
- Requires conda

Outline
-------

1. [bash] Create a directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir mysci
   ```
   
1. [bash] Go into the directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd mysci
   ```
   
1. [conda] Create a virtual environment for this project:

   ```bash
   $ conda create --name mysci python
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduce conda and conda environments

1. [git] Make the directory a git repository:

   ```bash
   $ git init .
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduce Git
   
1. [bash] Create a data directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir data
   ```
   
1. [bash] Go into the data directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd data
   ```
   
1. [bash] Download sample data:

   ```bash
   $ curl -O https://sundowner.colorado.edu/weather/atoc8/wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** A note about the CU Boulder weather station
   
1. [git] Add the file to the *git staging area*:

   ```bash
   $ git add wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain "git staging"
   
1. [git] Commit the file to the *git repository*:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding sample data file"
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain "git commits"

1. [git] Look at the git logs:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain git logs and history

1. [bash] Go back to the top-level directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd ..
   ```
   
1. [bash] Create a blank Python script:

   ```bash
   $ touch mysci.py
   ```

1. [python] Edit the `mysci.py` file:

   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```
   
1. [python] Try testing the script:

   ```bash
   $ python mysci.py
   ```
   
   **NOTE:**  Yay!  You've just created your first Python script.
   We'll repeat this step to test our script regularly.
   
1. [python] Now delete the `print("Hello, world!")` line
   from the `mysci.py` file, and let's read our sample data file.
   Change the `mysci.py` script to read:
   
   ```python
   # Read the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
       data = datafile.read()
   
   # DEBUG
   print(data)
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces code comments, strings (single- and double-quote),
   `open` (for text files), context managers (i.e., `with`), Python
   indentation.  Also note the format of the data file!

1. [python] What did we just see?  What is the `data` object?  What
   type is `data`?  How do we find out?  Add the following to the
   `DEBUG` section of our script:
   
   ```python
   print(type(data))
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `type`

1. [python] Try testing the script, again.

   **NOTE:** We see that `data` is a string.
   
1. [git] Now, clean up the script by removing the `DEBUG`
   section, before we commit this to git.

1. [git] Let's check the status of our git repository

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```
   
   Note what files have been changed in the repository.

1. [git] Stage these changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add mysci.py
   ```

1. [git] Let's check the status of our git repository,
   again.  What's different from the last time we 
   checked the status?

1. [git] Commit these changes:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding script file"
   ```

1. [git] Let's check the status of our git repository,
   now.  It should tell you that there are no changes
   made to your repository (i.e., your repository is
   up-to-date with the state of the code in your
   directory).

1. [git] Look at the git logs, again:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain the changes in the logs.
   Introduce simplified logs with the `--oneline` option.

1. [python] Now, one big string isn't very useful, so let's 
   consider parsing the data file into a data structure we
   can use.  Change the `mysci.py` script to read:
   
   ```python
   # Initialize my data variable
   data = []
   
   # Read and parse the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
   
       # Read the first three lines (header)
       for _ in range(3):
           datafile.readline()
       
       # Read and parse the rest of the file
       for line in datafile:
           data.append(line.split())
   
   # DEBUG
   for datum in data:
      print(datum)
   ```
   **NOTE:** Introduces `File.readline()`, `for` loop, "iterables" (i.e.,
   `datafile` is "iterable"), the `_` variable, `range`, unassigned function
   return values (i.e., `datafile.readline()`), `str.split()`, `list` and
   `list.append()`.  Note that each row in `data` is a list of its own,
   and that each item in each row is a `str` (i.e., quoted).
   
   That's a lot of stuff in a very little bit a code!

1. [python] Now, we'll get the first, 10th, and last row in `data`.  
   Change the `DEBUG` section of our `mysci.py` script to:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   print(data[0])
   print(data[9])
   print(data[-1])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `[index]` (i.e., `getitem`) notation, zero-based
   indexing, and negative indexes.  Also, note that each row is a `list`!

1. [python] Now, we'll get the first 10 rows in `data`.  
   Change the `DEBUG` section of our `mysci.py` script to:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   for datum in data[0:10]:
       print(datum)
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `slice` indexing.  Have students see what happens
   with `data[:10]`, `data[0:10:2]`, and `data[slice(0,10,2)]`.  What's the
   difference?  Explain `slice`.

1. [python] Exercise: Try getting the 5th, first 5, and every other *column*
   of rows `8` in `data`.
   
   Solution: Change the `DEBUG` section of the `mysci.py` script to:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   print(data[8][4])
   print(data[8][:5])
   print(data[8][::2])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces nested-`list` indexing.  Note that when printing
   strings to the screen, the quotation marks are not displayed!  (They
   are only displayed when you are printing the list containing the strings.)
   Also, what happens when you try something like `data[5:8][4]`?  You should
   get an error!  Why?

1. [git] Clean up the file (remove `DEBUG` section), stage the changes, and
   commit. (i.e., `git add mysci.py` and `git commit -m "Parsing file"`)

1. [python] Can you remember which column is which?  Is time the first
   column or the second?  Which column is the temperature?
   
   Each column is a time-series of data.  We would ideally like each
   time-series easily accessible, which is *not* the case when `data`
   is row-column ordered (like it currently is).  (Remember what happens
   when you try to do something like `data[:][4]`!)
   
   Let's get our data into a more convenient named-column format.
   Change `mysci.py` to the following:

   ```python
   # Initialize my data variable
   data = {'date': [],
           'time': [],
           'tempout': []}
   
   # Read and parse the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
   
       # Read the first three lines (header)
       for _ in range(3):
           datafile.readline()
       
       # Read and parse the rest of the file
       for line in datafile:
           split_line = line.split()
           data['date'].append(split_line[0])
           data['time'].append(split_line[1])
           data['tempout'].append(split_line[2])
   
   # DEBUG
   print(data['time'])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `dict` and `{}` short-hand; talk about
   `list` vs `dict`, why use one over another?  Advantages and
   disadvantages of `dict`s and `lists`.  Note that the output
   is a `list` of `str`s.

1. [git] Clean up (remove `DEBUG` section), stage, and commit
   (`git commit -m "Parsing select time-series"`)

1. [python] Now it's easy to get the time-series information
   for each column that we are interested in grabbing, and we
   can get each column by name.  However, everything read from
   the text file is a `str`.  What if we want to do math on this
   data, then we need it to be a different data type!
   
   So, let's convert the `tempout` time-series to be a `float`
   by changing the line:
   
   ```python
           data['tempout'].append(split_line[2])   
   ```
   
   to:
   
   ```python
           data['tempout'].append(float(split_line[2]))
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Should also introduce `int`.

1. [python] Add a `DEBUG` section at the end and see what
   `data['tempout']` now looks like.  Do you see a difference?
   It should now be a `list` of `float`s.

1. [git] Clean up (remove `DEBUG` section), stage, and commit
   (`git commit -m "Converting tempout to floats"`)

1. [python] This seems great, so far!  But what if we want to
   read more columns to our data later?  We will have to change
   the initialization of the `data` variable (at the top of 
   `mysci.py`) *and* we will have to add the appropriate line
   in the "read and parse" section.  Essentially, that means
   you need to maintain 2 parts of the code and make sure that
   both remain consistent with each other.
   
   This is generally not good practice.  Ideally, you want to
   be able to change only 1 part of the code and know that
   the rest of the code will remain consistent.  So, let's fix
   this.
   
   Change `mysci.py` to:
   
   ```python
   # Column names and column indices to read
   columns = {'date': 0, 'time': 1, 'tempout': 2}

   # Data types for each column (only if non-string)
   types = {'tempout': float}

   # Initialize my data variable
   data = {}
   for column in columns:
       data[column] = []

   # Read and parse the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:

       # Read the first three lines (header)
       for _ in range(3):
           datafile.readline()

       # Read and parse the rest of the file
       for line in datafile:
           split_line = line.split()
           for column in columns:
               i = columns[column]
               t = types.get(column, str)
               value = t(split_line[i])
               data[column].append(value)

   # DEBUG
   print(data['tempout'])
   ```
   
   Now we only need to modify the `columns` variable
   to indicate which columns of the data file to read
   and the `types` variable to indicate to what type to
   convert the data.
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces passing types/functions as arguments
   (or holding pointers to types/functions in a variable,
   namely the `types` variable), looping over `dict`s, adding
   key-value pairs to a `dict` via assignment, and the
   `dict.get()` method (to avoid key-not-found errors)

1. [git] Clean up (remove `DEBUG` section), stage, and commit
   (`git commit -m "Refactoring data parsing code"`)

1. [python] Okay, now that we've read the data in a way that
   is easy to modify later, let's actually do something with
   the data.
   
   Let's compute the *wind chill* factor.  We've read the
   temperature data into the `tempout` variable, but we need
   to read the `windspeed` variable from column `7`.  So,
   let's modify the `columns` variable to read:
   
   ```python
   columns = {'date': 0, 'time': 1, 'tempout': 2, 'windspeed': 7}
   ```
   
   and modify the `types` variable to be:
   
   ```python
   types = {'tempout': float, 'windspeed': float}
   ```
   
1. [git] Great!  Let's save this in our git repo.  Stage and
   commit (`git commit -m "Reading windspeed as well"`).

1. [python] Now, let's write our first function to compute
   the wind chill factor.  We'll add this function to the
   bottom of the file.
   
   ```python
   # Compute the wind chill temperature
   def compute_windchill(temp, windspeed):
       v16 = windspeed ** 0.16
       return 35.74 + 0.6215*temp - 35.75*v16 + 0.4275*temp*v16
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `def` for functions and math operators
   (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `**`).  Also mention `/` for division.
   
   And then let's compute a new list with `windchill` data at
   the bottom of `mysci.py`:
   
   ```python
   # Let's actually compute the wind chill factor
   windchill = []
   for temp, windspeed in zip(data['temp'], data['windspeed']):
       windchill.append(compute_windchill(temp, windspeed))
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `zip` and automatic "unraveling" of a
   `tuple`... Introduces `tuple`s implicitly, so should cover it.
   Take a look at `zip([1,2], [3,4,5])`.  What is the result?

   And finally, we'll add a typical `DEBUG` section to see the
   results:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   print(windchill)
   ```
   
   Test this out and see the results.
   
1. [git] Clean up, stage, and commit (`git commit -m "Compute wind chill factor"`)

1. [python] Now, the wind chill factor is actually in the data file,
   so we can read it from the file and compare that value to our computed
   values.  To do this, we need to read the `windchill` column as a `float`:
   
   ```python
   columns = {'date': 0, 'time': 1, 'tempout': 2, 'windspeed': 7,
              'windchill': 12}
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces line continuation indentation (I think?)
   
   and
   
   ```python
   types = {'tempout': float, 'windspeed': float, 'windchill': float}
   ```
   
   Then, let's add a `DEBUG` section at the end to compare the two
   different values (from `data` and computed by our function):
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   for wc_data, wc_comp in zip(data['windchill'], windchill):
       print(f'{wc_data:.5f}   {wc_comp:.5f}   {wc_data - wc_comp:.5f}')
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces f-strings with `float` formatting.  Point people 
   to different kinds of formatting that can be done in f-strings.
   
   Test the results.  What do you see?  Our computation isn't very good
   is it?


1. [git] Clean up, stage, and commit (`git commit -m "Compare wind chill factors"`)

1. [python] Now, let's format the output so that it's easy to understand and
   rename this script to something indicative of what it actually does.
   
   To the end of the file, let's add:
   
   ```python
   # Output comparison of data
   print('                ORIGINAL  COMPUTED')
   print(' DATE    TIME  WINDCHILL WINDCHILL DIFFERENCE')
   print('------- ------ --------- --------- ----------')
   for date, time, wc_orig, wc_comp in zip(data['date'], data['time'], data['windchill'], windchill):
       print(f'{date} {time:>6} {wc_orig:9.6f} {wc_comp:9.6f} {wc_orig-wc_comp:10.6f}')
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces f-string formatting of strings, `zip` with more than 2 arguments
   and more `float` formating options.
   
   You now have your first complete Python script!  Let's write another...
   
1. [git] DON'T CLEAN UP!  Just stage and commit
   (`git commit -m "Output formatting comparison data"`)

1. [git] Let's rename this script to something meaningful.

   ```bash
   $ git mv mysci.py windchillcomp.py
   $ git commit -m "Renaming first script"
   ```
