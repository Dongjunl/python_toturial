Python 0-30 for Scientists
==========================

This is an outline of the steps needed to teach Python 0-30.  The plan is to teach
Python in an example-based way demonstrating:

1. How to write Python code
1. Python best-practices
1. Coding with git & GitHub
1. Package management with Conda

with each being of equal importance.  This means that we intend to:

1. Use "the right" data structures for the intended task, without needed to depend upon external 3rd-party packages.
1. Commit early and commit often, so that each "lesson" is represented by a single git commit.
1. End the instruction with an installable package and demonstrate the usefulness of such packages.

Requirements & Assumptions
--------------------------

- Assumes a linux/mac OS (What about Windows?)
- Requires conda

Outline
-------

1. [bash] Create a directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir mysci
   ```
   
1. [bash] Go into the directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd mysci
   ```
   
1. [conda] Create a virtual environment for this project:

   ```bash
   $ conda create --name mysci python
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduce conda and conda environments

1. [git] Make the directory a git repository:

   ```bash
   $ git init .
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduce Git
   
1. [bash] Create a data directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir data
   ```
   
1. [bash] Go into the data directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd data
   ```
   
1. [bash] Download sample data:

   ```bash
   $ curl -O https://sundowner.colorado.edu/weather/atoc8/wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** A note about the CU Boulder weather station
   
1. [git] Add the file to the *git staging area*:

   ```bash
   $ git add wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain "git staging"
   
1. [git] Commit the file to the *git repository*:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding sample data file"
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain "git commits"

1. [git] Look at the git logs:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain git logs and history

1. [bash] Go back to the top-level directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd ..
   ```
   
1. [bash] Create a blank Python script:

   ```bash
   $ touch mysci.py
   ```

1. [python] Edit the `mysci.py` file:

   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```
   
1. [python] Try testing the script:

   ```bash
   $ python mysci.py
   ```
   
   **NOTE:**  Yay!  You've just created your first Python script.
   We'll repeat this step to test our script regularly.
   
1. [python] Now delete the `print("Hello, world!")` line
   from the `mysci.py` file, and let's read our sample data file.
   Change the `mysci.py` script to read:
   
   ```python
   # Read the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
       data = datafile.read()
   
   # DEBUG
   print(data)
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces code comments, strings (single- and double-quote),
   `open` (for text files), context managers (i.e., `with`), Python
   indentation.  Also note the format of the data file!

1. [python] What did we just see?  What is the `data` object?  What
   type is `data`?  How do we find out?  Add the following to the
   `DEBUG` section of our script:
   
   ```python
   print(type(data))
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `type`

1. [python] Try testing the script, again.

   **NOTE:** We see that `data` is a string.
   
1. [git] Now, clean up the script by removing the `DEBUG`
   section, before we commit this to git.

1. [git] Stage these changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add mysci.py
   ```
   
1. [git] Commit these changes:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding script file"
   ```

1. [git] Look at the git logs, again:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain the changes in the logs.
   Introduce simplified logs with the `--oneline` option.

1. [python] Now, one big string isn't very useful, so let's 
   consider parsing the data file into a data structure we
   can use.  Change the `mysci.py` script to read:
   
   ```python
   # Initialize my data variable
   data = []
   
   # Read and parse the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
   
       # Read the first three lines (header)
       for _ in range(3):
           datafile.readline()
       
       # Read and parse the rest of the file
       for line in datafile:
           data.append(line.split())
   
   # DEBUG
   for datum in data:
      print(datum)
   ```
   **NOTE:** Introduces `File.readline()`, `for` loop, "iterables" (i.e.,
   `datafile` is "iterable"), the `_` variable, `range`, unassigned function
   return values (i.e., `datafile.readline()`), `str.split()`, `list` and
   `list.append()`.  Note that each row in `data` is a list of its own,
   and that each item in each row is a `str` (i.e., quoted).
   
   That's a lot of stuff in a very little bit a code!

1. [python] Now, we'll get the first, 10th, and last row in `data`.  
   Change the `DEBUG` section of our `mysci.py` script to:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   print(data[0])
   print(data[9])
   print(data[-1])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `[index]` (i.e., `getitem`) notation, zero-based
   indexing, and negative indexes.  Also, note that each row is a `list`!

1. [python] Now, we'll get the first 10 rows in `data`.  
   Change the `DEBUG` section of our `mysci.py` script to:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   for datum in data[0:10]:
       print(datum)
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `slice` indexing.  Have students see what happens
   with `data[:10]`, `data[0:10:2]`, and `data[slice(0,10,2)]`.  What's the
   difference?  Explain `slice`.

1. [python] Exercise: Try getting the 5th, first 5, and every other *column*
   of rows `8` in `data`.
   
   Solution: Change the `DEBUG` section of the `mysci.py` script to:
   
   ```python
   # DEBUG
   print(data[8][4])
   print(data[8][:5])
   print(data[8][::2])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces nested-`list` indexing.  Note that when printing
   strings to the screen, the quotation marks are not displayed!  (They
   are only displayed when you are printing the list containing the strings.)
   Also, what happens when you try something like `data[5:8][4]`?  You should
   get an error!  Why?

1. [git] Clean up the file (remove `DEBUG` section), stage the changes, and
   commit. (i.e., `git add mysci.py` and `git commit -m "Parsing file"`)

1. [python] Can you remember which column is which?  Is time the first
   column or the second?  Which column is the temperature?
   
   Each column is a time-series of data.  We would ideally like each
   time-series easily accessible, which is *not* the case when `data`
   is row-column ordered (like it currently is).  (Remember what happens
   when you try to do something like `data[:][4]`!)
   
   Let's get our data into a more convenient named-column format.
   Change `mysci.py` to the following:

   ```python
   # Initialize my data variable
   data = {}
   
   # Read and parse the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
   
       # Read the first three lines (header)
       for _ in range(3):
           datafile.readline()
       
       # Read and parse the rest of the file
       for line in datafile:
           split_line = line.split()
           data['date'] = split_line[0]
           data['time'] = split_line[1]
           data['tempout'] = split_line[2]
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `dict` and `{}` short-hand
