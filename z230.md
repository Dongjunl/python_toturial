Python 0-30 for Scientists
==========================

This is an outline of the steps needed to teach Python 0-30.  The plan is to teach
Python in an example-based way demonstrating:

1. How to write Python code
1. Python best-practices
1. Coding with git & GitHub
1. Package management with Conda

with each being of equal importance.  This means that we intend to:

1. Use "the right" data structures for the intended task, without needed to depend upon external 3rd-party packages.
1. Commit early and commit often, so that each "lesson" is represented by a single git commit.
1. End the instruction with an installable package and demonstrate the usefulness of such packages.

Requirements & Assumptions
--------------------------

- Assumes a linux/mac OS (What about Windows?)
- Requires conda

Outline
-------

1. [bash] Create a directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir mysci
   ```
   
1. [bash] Go into the directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd mysci
   ```
   
1. [conda] Create a virtual environment for this project:

   ```bash
   $ conda create --name mysci python
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduce conda and conda environments

1. [git] Make the directory a git repository:

   ```bash
   $ git init .
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduce Git and VCSes
   
1. [bash] Create a data directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir data
   ```
   
1. [bash] Go into the data directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd data
   ```
   
1. [bash] Download sample data:

   ```bash
   $ curl -O https://sundowner.colorado.edu/weather/atoc8/wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
1. [git] Add the file to the *git staging area*:

   ```bash
   $ git add wxobs20170821.txt
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain what "git staging" is and why it matters
   
1. [git] Commit the file to the *git repository*:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding sample data file"
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain what "git commits" are.

1. [git] Look at the git logs:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Explain the logs and history

1. [bash] Go back to the top-level directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd ..
   ```
   
1. [bash] Create a blank Python script:

   ```bash
   $ touch mysci.py
   ```

1. [python] Edit the `mysci.py` file:

   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```
   
1. [python] Try testing the script:

   ```bash
   $ python mysci.py
   ```
   
   **NOTE:**  Yay!  You've just created your first Python script.
   
1. [python] Now delete the `print("Hello, world!")` line
   from the `mysci.py` file and change it with the following:
   
   
   ```python
   # Read the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
       data = datafile.read()
   
   # Print the data file contents and type
   print(data)
   print()
   print(type(data)
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces code comments, strings (single- and double-quote),
   `open`, context managers (i.e., `with`), Python indentation, and `type`.
   Also note the data file format!
   
1. [python] Try testing the script, again:

   ```bash
   $ python mysci.py
   ```
   
1. [git] Add the script to the git staging area:

   ```bash
   $ git add mysci.py
   ```
   
1. [git] Commit the file to the *git repository*:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Adding script file"
   ```

1. [git] Look at the git logs, again:

   ```bash
   $ git log
   ```
   **NOTE:** Explain the changes in the logs

1. [python] Now, let's parse the data file.  Change the `mysci.py`
   script to read:
   
   ```python
   # Initialize my data variable
   data = []
   
   # Read and parse the data file
   filename = "data/wxobs20170821.txt"
   with open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
   
       # Read the first three lines (header)
       header1 = datafile.readline()
       header2 = datafile.readline()
       header3 = datafile.readline()
       
       # Read and parse the rest of the file
       for line in datafile:
           data.append(line.split())
   
   # Print the data file contents and type
   for datum in data:
      print(datum)
   print()
   print(type(data)
   ```
   **NOTE:** Introduces `File.readline()`, `for` loop, "iterables" (i.e.,
   `datafile` is "iterable"), `str.split()`, `list` and `list.append()`.
   Note that each row in `data` is a list of its own, and that each
   item in each row is a `str` (i.e., quoted).

1. [python] Now, we'll get the first, 10th, and last row in `data`.  
   Add the following to the bottom of our `mysci.py` file:
   
   ```python
   # Print out some sample rows
   print(data[0])
   print(data[9])
   print(data[-1])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces `[index]` (i.e., `getitem`) notation, zero-based
   indexing, and negative indexes.  Also, note that each row is a `list`!

1. [python] Exercise: Try getting the first, 10th, and last *column*
   of row `8` in `data`.
   
   Solution: Add the following to the bottom of our `mysci.py` file:
   
   ```python
   # Print out some sample columns from row 8
   print(data[8][0])
   print(data[8][9])
   print(data[8][-1])
   ```
   
   **NOTE:** Introduces nested-`list` indexing.  Note that when printing
   strings to the screen, the quotation marks are not displayed!  (They
   are only displayed when you are printing the list containing the strings.)
